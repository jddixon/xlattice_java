<body>
  <p> As the term is used in XLattice, a <strong>protocol</strong> is a set
    of message types and a set of rules governing the sequencing of the
    messages.  We want to be able to describe protocols in abstract 
    terms and to be able to register handlers for specific types or
    messages or groups of message types within a protocol.

      <p>A TLV is a common structure in messages consisting
        of a numeric type followed by the length of the value in bytes
        and then a byte array of that length.  We shall implement two
        subtypes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>a <strong>TLV8</strong> in which the type and length are
          both unsigned bytes, 8-bit integers</li>
        <li>a <strong>TLV16</strong> in which the type and length are
          both unsigned 16-bit integers</li>
      </ul>
