    This section provides information on two protocols, STUN and Kademlia.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kademlia is a DHT which uses XOR as a metric.  That is, items in the
    DHT are represented by fixed-length binary keys, and the distance 
    between any two items is the byte-wise exclusive OR (XOR) of their
    keys.  Items might be either nodes or data being stored.  The Kademlia
    protocol is specified as running over UDP, although this does not seem
    to be an essential part of the protocol.
  </p>
  <p>
    STUN is a protocol used by clients behind NATs, network address
    translation devices, to discover information about the NATs and
    what the outside world sees as a client's IP address and port 
    number.
