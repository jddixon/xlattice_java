<body>
  <p>Kademlia is a UDP-based peer-to-peer communications protocol,
    a variation on the DHT (distributed hash table).  It is distinguished
    by its use of XOR as a metric.  
  </p>
  <p>Kademlia is widely copied.  
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMule">eMule</a>
    and 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDonkey">eDonkey</a>
    in particular are hugely successful, with millions of users.
    However, implementations diverge quite widely from the original
    protocol.
  </p>
  <p>Because the original Kademlia paper was somewhat less than clear
    on certain aspects, we provide a 
    <a href="specs.html">design specification</a> for the Kademlia
    protocol.  An implementation spec will follow.
