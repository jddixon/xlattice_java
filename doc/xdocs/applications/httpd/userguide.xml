<p>
These instructions are suitable for and have been tested with Sun's
Java and Linux, specifically Debian.  They should work equally well
with any other standard Java implementation and any version of 
Linux and most of UNIX.

The distribution is available at Sourceforge, on the 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=92652">
XLattice project page</a>
 or simply by clicking
<a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/xlattice/cryptoserver-0.0.9.zip?download">
here.</a>

<p>
If, for example, you intend to put your <code>
xlattice</code>
 directory below
<code>
abc</code>
, you would
</p>
<source>
mv cryptoserver-0.0.9.zip abc
unzip cryptoserver-0.0.9.zip</source>
<p>

</p>
<p>
This creates <code>
xlattice</code>
 and a number of subdirectories.

<source>
cd xlattice/cryptoserver
chmod u+x *.sh</source>

<section id="PutaWebSiteintheExpectedPlace"><title>Put a Web Site in the Expected Place</title>
<p>
The server expects to find configuration files in the <code>
xlattice</code>

subdirectory and content files for Web sites in named subdirectories 
of the <code>
sites</code>
 subdirectory.  In our example, this gives you a 
directory structure like this
</p>
<source>
abc
  xlattice
    lib
      xlattice
        cryptoserver-0.0.9.jar
        ... etc ...
    cryptoserver
      sites
        www.siteA.com
          ... files and subdirectories ...
        www.siteB.com
          ... files and subdirectories ...
      xlattice
        ... configuration files ...</source>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The various jars used by the Cryptoserver are organized under
<code>
xlattice/lib</code>
 by vendor name.  All are open source.  Licenses
are included in the same subdirectories as the jars.
</p>
<p>
If the URL for your Web site were for example <a href="http://www.siteA.com,">
http://www.siteA.com,</a>

then you would need to put the files for your Web site below 
<strong>
www.siteA.com.</strong>
  The home
page, for example, should be at <code>
www.siteA.com/index.html.</code>

</p>
<p>
This week's CryptoServer should be able to handle more than 
one Web site but this functionality has not been thoroughly
tested.
</p>
</section>
<section id="RuntheServer"><title>Run the Server</title>
<p>
Just type
</p>
<source>
./cryptoserver.sh -n www.siteA.com -p 8080</source>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The name after <strong>
-n</strong>
 is the Web site name.  The number after <strong>
-p</strong>

is the port number.  This defaults to 80, but if you run the
server at this or any other port less than 1024, it must be run
as root.
</p>
<p>
Logs are found in the directory you execute the above command from.
There are three
</p>
<ul>
<li>
  <strong>
access.log,</strong>
 which logs every hit
</li>
<li>
  <strong>
error.log,</strong>
 which records misses and other faults
</li>
<li>
  <strong>
debug.log,</strong>
 which babbles at some length 
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The last log is of little value to anyone but developers.
</p>
<p>
If the log files grow too large they can be renamed and then
trimmed, compressed, or deleted.  The server will create a new 
file when it next uses the log.  It is probably best to pause
shortly after renaming.
</p>

<section id="SeeingYourStuff"><title>Seeing Your Stuff</title>
<p>
If your server is for example <code>
myserver.abc.com</code>
 and on port 80,
the default, then you would browse to
</p>
<source>
http://myserver.abc.com</source>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The CryptoServer will continue to serve pages until you kill it.
