    <section id="FreenetGatewayTests"><title>Freenet Gateway Tests</title>
      <p>These are a series of tests that constitute proof that XLattice
        has successfully implemented the various Freenet protocols and
        then may demonstrate certain weaknesses in Freenet.</p>
      <ul>      
        <li><strong>network join</strong></li>
        <li><strong>data insertion and retrieval</strong></li>
        <li><strong>network mapping</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>star detection</strong></li>
        <li><strong>training</strong></li>
        <li><strong>ring creation</strong></li>
        <li><strong>ring rotation</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The first two items, join, insertion, and retrieval, are
        the basic Freenet protocols. Any correct implementation
        should be able to carry out these operations.</p>

      <p>If a comprehensive map can be built of Freenet, item 3, 
        it suggests that Freenet's basic guarantee of anonymity is 
        at risk.</p>

      <p>If XLattice can determine which nodes specialize in which
        keys, item 4, this is more certain.  If XLattice can force 
        individual nodes to specialize, item 5, it is definite.  
        If XLattice can manipulate the behaviour of the entire network, 
        items 6 and 7, there is no doubt at all: 
        Freenet cannot guarantee anonymity to its users.</p>

      <section id="NetworkJoin"><title>Network Join</title>
        <p>An XLattice node must be able to <strong>join</strong> Freenet, 
          in the sense that it must be able to announce itself to
          an arbitrarily selected Freenet node and acquire a Freenet
          identity, allowing to insert data into Freenet and retrieve 
          data from it.</p>  
        
        <p>Once one XLattice node has joined Freenet,
          we believe that it can introduce an arbitrary number of other 
          (possibly phantom) XLattice nodes.  This would demonstrate 
          that Freenet is susceptible to 
          <a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/douceur02sybil.html">
            Sybil attacks,</a> in which nodes acquire multiple
          false identities.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="DataInsertionandRetrieval">
        <title>Data Insertion and Retrieval</title>
        <p>Having joined Freenet, an XLattice node must be able to
          insert data into the network and retrieve data from it.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="NetworkMapping"><title>Network Mapping</title>
        <p>An XLattice node must be able to build a reliable map showing 
          all active Freenet network nodes and characterise those nodes
          to some degree.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="StarDetection"><title>Star Detection</title>
        <p>It should be possible for an XLattice node to determine which
          Freenet nodes reliably return keys in a certain region of 
          key space.  That is, it should be able to find out which nodes
          have specialized successfully.  We refer to a node which has a
          well-defined and stable specialization as a <strong>star.</strong></p>
      </section>
      <section id="Training"><title>Training</title>
        <p>It should be possible for an XLattice node or possibly a cluster
          of such nodes to <strong>train</strong> Freenet nodes, increasing or 
        changing their specialization.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="RingCreation"><title>Ring Creation</title>
        <p>Given the ability to train Freenet nodes, it should be possible
          to train a set of stars with non-overlapping specialities whose
          specialities taken together cover key space.  For example, 
          sixteen such nodes might each specialize in keys beginning with
          one of the hex digits.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="RingRotation"><title>Ring Rotation</title>
        <p>Given the ability to create a ring of Freenet stars, it should
          be possible to rotate that ring, meaning that the specializations
          of each node would gradually change in the same direction and at
          the same rate.  For example, the zero node in the ring might on
          the first day specialize in keys in the range 0x00-0x0f,
          on the second day in keys in the range 0x01-0x10,
          on the third in keys in the range 0x02-0x11,
          and so forth.</p>
