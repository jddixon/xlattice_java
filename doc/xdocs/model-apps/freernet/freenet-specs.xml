    <section id="FreenetSpecifications"><title>Freenet Specifications</title>
      <p>This is a difficult topic because Freenet is in fact poorly
        specified.  There is little documentation and the developers
        make frequent changes to the protocols in use.  One consequence
        is that the network is at the time of writing (mid-February 2004)
        split into three.  Officially, there are two networks, 
        <strong>stable</strong> and <strong>unstable,</strong> the former meant for general 
        use and the latter reserved for developers.  The networks generally
        are incompatible at the protocol level.</p>
      
      <p>However on 8 February stable build 5066
        was released; this used protocols incompatible with stable build 5065
        and previous builds, and so split the stable network in two.  To
        make matters worse, 5066 was buggy, and almost immediately replaced
        by stable build 5067.  This introduced still more bugs, and so was
        replaced the next day by stable build 5068.  The upshot is that
        there are at least three Freenet networks: the older stable network, 
        compatible with build 5065; the newer stable network, currently at
        build 5068; and the unstable network, which sees new releases at 
        least on a daily basis.</p>
      
      <p>This description will focus on Freenet's protocols as of 
        build 5065, the last version used
        in the older stable network.  If the newer stable version settles
        down, we will revise the specifications here accordingly.</p>
