    <section id="overview"><title>Overview</title>
      <p>This would be a universal peer-to-peer file-sharing system
        similar to <a href="http://www.freenetproject.org">Freenet</a>
        and, to a lesser extent, <a href="http://mnet.sf.org">mnet.</a> 
        It will be quite desirable for XLattice to support gateways
        into at least these two networks.
      </p>
      <note>
        Well, at the time of writing (2006-03-28) both Freenet and 
        mnet are more or less gone from this world.  Leaving
        this section in need of revision.

      <table>
        <tr><td>browser interface</td>
          <td>A browser interface to 
            system contents will be essential because of the
            unsophistication of likely users.  For security,
            this browser interface must connect to the XLattice 
            console.
            The user will be able to use this interface both to
            view files retrieved from the system and to manage 
            cache and shared file policies.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>shared file space</td>
          <td>The user needs to be able to set an amount of disk
            space made available to the system.  The system needs
            to be able to confirm that the user is actually making
            this amount available.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>cache</td>
          <td>The user also needs to be able to configure 
            a caching policy: at least the amount of space reserved 
            for this purpose and the length of time that files
            retrieved from the system will be held in the cache.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>network file management</td>
          <td>This is application-specific code for managing
            the replication, dispersal, and retrieval of files in
            the anonymous file sharing system.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>log</td>
          <td>Extensive logging would be necessary; this requirement
            is very much at odds with the need for privacy and for
            protection from traffic analysis.
