    <section id="fnp"><title>Freenet Network Protocol (FNP)</title>
      <p>Officially there are three Freenet protocols:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>announcement,</strong> by which a node introduces itself
            to other nodes</li>
          <li><strong>insertion,</strong> used to insert a new file into the 
            network</li>
          <li><strong>retrieval,</strong> used to fetch the file corresponding
            to a given key from the network</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each protocol is defined by a set of sequences of messages.  
        Many of these 
        messages are shared between the protocols.
      </p>
      <section id="Inter-nodeMessages"><title>Inter-node Messages</title>
        <p>The messages discussed here are external messages 
          passed between Freenet nodes.
          They must be distinguished from the internal messages 
          used to manage the node's internal state machine.</p>
