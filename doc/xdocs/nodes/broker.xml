      <p>A broker is an N:N device that connects many (an indefinite
        number of) nodes to many other nodes.  Its primary purpose is
        message routing, although it may use local store as a message
        pool.  Messages will be routed according to a local policy,
        part of which will be determined by the specific brokering module
        used and part of which will be configured in some manner, 
        usually by a configuration table.  Where necessary, a broker
        will perform protocol translation in routing a message.</p>

      <p>Where a node is behind a organizational firewall, it may be
        that messages to and from that node may have to be routed
        indirectly, through a nearby broker.</p>

      <p>A broker has much the same functionality as an Internet 
        <strong>router.</strong>  It would be possible for brokers to exchange
        routing information, exactly as Internet routers do.</p>
        
      <p>Throughout this document, the term <strong>broker</strong> will 
          always mean an XLattice broker as described in this section,
          except where otherwise qualified.</p>
