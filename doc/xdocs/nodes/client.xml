      <p>This type of node is normally connected to a human being,
        the user, either 
        directly or via a <strong>virtual console.</strong>  The console 
        enables the user to interface to several nodes at one
        time.  A user node has 1:N connectivity, 
        meaning that it connects one
        entity (the user) to many.  The user node will normally 
        have direct access to at least part of the file system on 
        the user's computer.
