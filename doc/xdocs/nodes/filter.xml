      <p>A filter is a 1:1 node whose function is to connect one 
        node to another, filtering messages between them
        at high speed.  It may use local store as a message pool.
        Messages will be filtered according to a policy, part of 
        which is determined by the filter module used and part by
        a configuration file of some sort.</p>

      <p>Filters will normally be positioned at network (lattice) 
        boundaries.  The filter will enforce the message filtering
        policy of the network which controls it.  Because a filter
        is a 1:1 device, there will normally be a router on each of its 
        interfaces in this application.</p>

      <p>A filter has much the same functionality as an Internet
        <strong>firewall</strong> and is best understood as such.</p>
      
      <p>Throughout this document, the term <strong>filter</strong> will 
          always mean an XLattice filter as described in this section,
          except where otherwise qualified.</p>
