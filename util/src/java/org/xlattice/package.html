  <p>This package contains abstractions for all of the basic types
  dealt with in XLattice.</p>
  
  <p>A Node has a 20-byte NodeID, a 160-bit number which is unique 
  to the node, serves to identify it, and can be used to route messages
  to it.  It also has a cryptographic key pair, usually a 1024 bit value.
  This is used to prove the Node's identity.  The Node's public key is 
  published, so anyone can encrypt a message using the public key; by
  decrypting the message, the Node proves that it has the corresponding
  private (secret) key materials.  Alternatively, the Node can use the
  key to sign messages which anyone can verify using the public key.
  </p>
  
  <p>A Node may have neighbors, Peers, which are also Nodes.  Each
  Peer will have a unique NodeID and a PublicKey used to prove its
  identity.</p>  
  
  <p>Nodes communicate over Overlays.  A Overlay is an Address space 
  and a transport Protocol which supports passing Messages and other
  data.  The Internet can be seen as a Overlay over IP address space
  which uses IP, the Internet Protocol, to route messages.  Nodes can
  be Internet hosts.  Normally such Nodes will have multiple Addresses
  in the form of IP address:port number pairs.  An address reached 
  using some particular protocol is an EndPoint.  That is, an EndPoint
  is characterized by a Protocol and an Address.</p>

  <p>Messages are passed over Connections.  A Connection has two 
  EndPoints.  One of these will have an Address on a Node.  The other
  will have an Address on one of the Node's Peers.  Connections are 
  most often created when one Node requests a Connection from an Acceptor 
  belonging to one of its Peers.  A Node maintains a list of Connectors 
  used in establishing Connections with each Peer.  The list is in order, 
  with earlier Connectors more preferred.</p>

  <p>So a Node uses an Acceptor to listen for connection requests from
  Peers, and it uses Connectors to call other Nodes' Acceptors.</p>

  <p>Messages can also be sent to an EndPoint.  In such case the 
  sending Node need not be aware of the Peer, if any, associated with
  the EndPoint.  The Message may be sent directly, or via another
  EndPoint, which may be one of a set of EndPoints associated with a Peer.
  In such a case the Peer is being used as a gateway.
  </p>

  <p>A set of email addresses and SMTP, the email protocol, constitute 
  an Overlay.  Email uses the underlying TCP/IP Overlay to route
  messages.</p>
