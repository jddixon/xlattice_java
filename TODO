xlattice_java/TODO

    * subprojects (util, corexml, crypto, etc) split off as separate
        projects                                                        * DONE
    * doc/ and xdocs/ need to be merged 
    * must ensure that xlattice_java subprojects use LICENSE.html,
        the XLattice license
        - this seems to be correct on project websites; must verify 
            in each case
            * confusion: both LICENSE.md and LICENSE.html present
                in at least some cases
        - text on jddixon.github.io websites incorrectly states 
            that project software is under an MIT license

    * FIX: index.html not being updated to github

    * version number in Version.java in all components must be
        derived from the version number in build.xml
        - add python script to enforce this?
            * script exists! see ~/dev/py/reconcileJava
            * needs better name ?
            * needs some documentation

    * antlr version in use is quite old
        - 4-4.1 build fails 'for unknown reason'

    * remove xdocs from github.com/jddixon/xlattice_j, add to 
        jddixon.xlattice.io/xlattice_j

    * rebuild dist after reconcileJava run
        - util                                                          * DONE
        - corexml                                                       * DONE
        - crypto
        - transport
        - protocol
        - overlay
        - node
        - httpd
        - projmgr

    * FIX: TestHttpOverTcp goes into an infinite loop       

2013-06-02
    * URGENT: whatever generates Version.java creates incorrect
        code: corexml/src/java/org/xlattice/corexml/Version.java was
        missing a closing RPAREN at line 16
    * build.xml succeeds despite compilation errors

2013-05-25
    * LICENSE.txt is html; should strip that out or rename
        to LICENSE.html
