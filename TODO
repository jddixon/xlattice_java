    * version number in Version.java in all components must be
        derived from the version number in build.xml
        - add python script to enforce this?
    * projmgr build fails because antlr jar missing
    * antlr4-4.1 build fails because 'lib creation was not 
        successful for an unknown reason'  hmmmmm...

    * URGENT: whatever generates Version.java creates incorrect
        code: corexml/src/java/org/xlattice/corexml/Version.java was
        missing a closing RPAREN at line 16
    * build.xml succeeds despite compilation errors

    * LICENSE.txt is html; should strip that out or rename
        to LICENSE.html
