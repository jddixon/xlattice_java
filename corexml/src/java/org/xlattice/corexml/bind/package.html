    This is a Java data binding facility.
  </p><p>
    XML documents are bound to instances of Java classes by 
    writing what amounts to a description of the binding in terms
    of a number of classes:
    <ul>
      <li>a <b>Mapping,</b> which relates the top-level XML element
        to the topmost Java class instance</li>
      <li><b>SubMappings,</b> used where a subelement maps into a
        child object</li>
      <li><b>Bindings,</b> which relate XML values to values of fields 
        in objects:
        <ul>
          <li><b>AttrBindings,</b> connecting attributes to fields</li>
          <li><b>EmptyElBindings,</b> which set a boolean to true if a 
            subelement is present</li>
          <li><b>SubElBindings,</b> which connect the value of a 
            subelement to a field value, and</li>
          <li><b>TextBindings,</b> relating the text within a
            subelement to a String field in the corresponding object
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>Collectors,</b> signalling the presence of a element 
        in the XML which does not cause the creation of a Java object
        on input</li>
      <li><b>Interfaces</b>, where a set of submappings map into 
        a set of classes implementing the same Java interface</li>
    </ul>
    The constituents may either be optional or allowed to repeat.
  </p><p>
    Additional descriptor classes will be added after more experience
    with the package in its current form.  We also intend to add a 
    facility for generating the mapping from an XML description.
