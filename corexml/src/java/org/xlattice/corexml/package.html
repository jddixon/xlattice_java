      This package provides the XML capability essential to XLattice.
    </p><p>
      CoreXml is based on the XML established pull parser technology and
      so can parse any valid XML input.
    </p><p>
      In many cases, all that is needed is the ability to set program
      parameters using a simple configuration file.  In this case the
      <code>SimpleConfig</code> class can be used to bind program variables
      to element values in the configuration file.
    </p><p>
      Those with more elaborate requirements can use 
      <code>corexml.bind's</code> data binding capabilities to 
      automatically convert arbitrarily complex XML input into sets
      of Java objects or to perform the reverse translation, 
      generating XML from trees of Java objects.  All that is necessary
      is to set up a data structure specifying the mapping from one
      to the other.
    </p><p>
      An alternative approach is to use XPath expressions to extract
      values from an XML document.  While not a complete implementation,
      <code>corexml.expr</code> provides much of XPath's capabilities.
      This is especially valuable when used in conjunction with 
      <code>corexml.context,</code> which supports nested symbol 
      tables as used in, for example, Ant.  This allows XML configuration
      files to be generalized by using bracketed variables (enclosed in
      <code>${}</code>) which are resolved against the symbol table.
    </p><p>
      All of this functionality is based on CoreXml's XML object model,
      <code>corexml.om</code>.  This is a set of classes and methods 
      that allows easy manipulation of XML documents as trees of nodes.
