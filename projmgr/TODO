    * upgrade: existing code uses ancient 2.7.4 antlr
        - tentatively switch to antlr 4.1 (github antlr/antlr4),
            if that is stable enough
        - instructions in project README.md
    * project.xml points at sf.net
    * need a tool to keep jar file version numbers correct in the
        various build.xmls
        - isn't projmgr that tool??
