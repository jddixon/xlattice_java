  <H1>Overview</H1>
  <p>JML is a utility for producing HTML from simple text with a 
  minimum of markup.  By default it actually generates XML in
  Anakia format.  The XML output files are then merged with standard
  templates to generate Web site pages.
  </p>

  <H1>Command Line</H1>
  <p>JML will normally be run in the <code>jml</code> subdirectory of
  a project's base directory.  By default input files have a <code>.jml</code>
  extension and JML will write its output to a file with the same base name
  and a <code>.html</code> extension in the <code>xdocs</code> subdirectory
  of the base directory.</p>

  <p>As an example, if under UNIX/Linux you type</p>
<pre>
    cd jml
    jml foo
</pre>
  <p>JML will read <code>jml/foo.jml</code> and write its output to
  <code>xdocs/foo.xml.</code></p>

  <p>There are a number of command line options.  Typing</p>
<pre>
    jml -h
</pre>
  <p>will give you a brief description of those currently available.</p>
  <H1>Markup</H1>
  <H3>Title and Author</H3>
  <p>The utility expects the first line of the file to be its title.
  The author may optionally be specified in the second line by an
  expression line</p>
<pre>
    %author(fred, fred@freddy.com)
</pre>
  <p>Whatever precedes the comma is interpreted as the author's name.
  Whatever follows it is an email address. </p>
  <H3>Section Headings</H3>
  <p>Section and subsection titles appear on lines by themselves with
  one or sharp signs (#) respectively as the first character(s).  So</p>
<pre>
# Gone with the Wind
</pre>
  <p>is translated into</p>
<pre>
&lt;section name="Gone with the Wind"&gt;
</pre>
  <p>Only two levels are currently supported.</p>

  <H3>Text Font Selection</H3>

  <p>This level of markup is done by bracketing text with single 
  characters representing the kind of formatting wanted.  For example,
  <code>*make me bold*</code> generates <b>make me bold.</b>   The set
  currently available is </p>

  <table>
      <tr><th>char</th><th><desc</th><th>result</th></tr>
      <tr><td>*</td><td>star</td><td>make <b>bold</b></td></tr>
      <tr><td>_</td><td>underscore</td><td><i>italicize</i></td></tr>
      <tr><td>`</td><td>left single quote</td><td>use <tt>teletype</tt> font, usually for code</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>These markups may not be nested.  Expressions like *_whatever_*
  will have an unpredictable result.</p>

  <H3>Excaping Formatting Characters</H3>

  <p>Any characters with special meaning to JML can be used normally by
  preceding them with a backslash.</p>

  <H3>Lists</H3>

  <p>HTML's ordered and unordered lists are produced by writing 'o ' or
  '1 ' (lower case letter O and the digit 1) at the beginning of a line.  So</p>
<pre>
o foo
o bar
</pre>
  <p>will generate</p>
<pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;foo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
  <p>which becomes</p>
  <ul>
      <li>foo</li>
      <li>bar</li>
  </ul>
  <p>when rendered by the browser.</p>
  <p>Lists may not be nested.</p>

  <H3>Blocks</H3>
  <p>If you want text to just be passed through unchanged, begin the
  block with {{ at the left margin and end it with }}.  Whatever 
  occurs between these becomes Anakia <code>&lt;source&gt;</code>
  blocks, appearing in the output in a teletype font and inside a 
  box.</p>

  <H3>Blockquotes</H3>
  <p>Marked by beginning a line with space-doublequote ( ") and ending
  the blockquote with another doublequote (").</p>
