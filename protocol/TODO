    * need stun server on AWS with two IP addresses
    * stun.server.properties are wrong
    * stunplus-files/xlattice/stun.server.properties are wrong
    * above need to be added to git
    * protocol/stunplus-files/xlattice/LICENSE.txt duplicated ?
    * protocol/stunplus-files/xlattice/bin missing
    * protocol/stunplus-files/xlattice/keystores missing
    * protocol/stunplus-files/xlattice/lib missing
    * Javadocs apparently refer to org.xlattice.crypto.tls, and 
        this does not exist

    * STUN tests are against 192.168.152.100 whereas test is 
        configured with 192.168.152.200/201
    * install xlattice_j on test, get stun servers running on 
        200-201 (javac is gcj-4.7)
    * if possible, install xlattice_j (util, crypto, transport,
        protocol) on ns4 using gcj or IBM Java

    * need a timeout on authentication; it generally fails by simply 
        hanging if a remote server is involved.  See TestClient.java, 
        search on TIMEOUT

    * testing is currently screwed up; needs distinct IP addresses for 
        STUN primary and secondary servers, but I now have both on 
        127.0.0.1.  This causes collisions in TestServer.java.  Needs 
        to be cleaned up.  FIXED by 2011-09-03
